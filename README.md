Job seekers are able to scan a QR code attached to a form to transmit their information to the service provider. The job seeker's data is stored directly on their device in their browser's local storage.

The [first version of this system](https://github.com/codeforamerica/qr-portable-profile) uses a central database to store job seeker data which can be sent to a specific service provider. Case managers scan a job seeeker's QR code and that looks up their information in the database and enters it to the service provider's system via website or Chrome Extension.

#### User Impact
Enable job seekers to share their information with different service providers so that they can get more customized service and not enter the same information many times.

#### Government System Impact
Support collaboration across silos in the workforce system, and give service providers feedback re the referrals that they are making.
